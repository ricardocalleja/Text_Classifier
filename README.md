<h1>Using a text classifier</h1>
<p>Thanks to fastai I was able to use a model language trained on Wikipedia articles, then train this model with a a set of movies review on a IMDB database, and after that create a text classifier that will label any review as "pos" or "neg"  </p>
<p>With a data set of the reviews of any bussiness each company could make an analysis on what their customer think about any product or service</p>
